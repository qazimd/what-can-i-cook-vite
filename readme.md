## üì¶ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/what-can-i-cook.git
cd what-can-i-cook
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Create `.env` file in the root:**
```env
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
```

4. **Run locally with Netlify Dev:**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify dev
```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:8888` ‚ú®

## üîê API Key Management
- API calls are made securely through Netlify Functions
- Keys are stored in `.env` (and excluded from Git)
- For deployment (e.g. Netlify), add your key in the **Environment Variables** section of the site settings

## üß± Folder Structure
```
/netlify/functions/   # Serverless functions (e.g. getRecipe.js)
/src/                 # React App
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx         # Main app logic
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css       # Tailwind setup
.env                  # Local environment variables
```

## üöß Rate Limiting
To protect API usage, each IP address is limited to **5 requests per minute** via in-memory tracking inside the Netlify Function.

## üí° Prompt Logic
- Includes selected meal type in the prompt
- Adapts based on whether it's an alternative request
- Follow-up questions to ChefBot include recipe context
